  - Inventory & catalog management
  - Order fulfillment
  - Internal/external communications
  - Other tasks?

### Ecosystem & Value Exchange

- What value propositions, trade-offs or efficiencies does 607 CSA offer each of these main players?

### Decision Making, Tracking & Reporting
- How do you come to agreements on the amount and price of each farmer's CSA contribution? How much is determined in advance? How much after-the-fact?
- What other factors (eg, truck routing, budget, product balance, etc) involve collective decision making?
- What numbers or answers are you most frequently trying to track down? which ones are the most important? and which are hardest to know precisely?

### Growth & Marketing
- How do the main players find you? or do you find them?
- Are there facets of the business you hope to grow? shrink? replicate? replace?


## Stray thoughts (Jamie's)

  - is it working?
- Farm Stand, chefs doing alternatives to benefit dinners (this sounds cool)
- shipping manifests?
